Save the Fishies

Do your best to catch the fish in the water and keep them safe. Every fish you catch will increase your score by one.
Move the mouse side to side to move the water under the fish. Be wary of the obstacles. Enjoy an ocean blue background, a 
crustacean red barriers, and a kelp green scoreboard. Had fun making this game, struggled with object collison/pushing files.

Sam made the obstacle course and fish design. He also had the fish drop at random intervals. Mason coded the pull to move and the
scoreboard. Both were vital to the development of the game idea.
